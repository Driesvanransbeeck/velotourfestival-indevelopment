This is the website of the Velo Tour Festival, an event for cycling enthusiasts in Belgium who gather to make a 3-day bicycle tour, share their excitement about bike touring and have a great time together. This festival is for not-for-profit and entirely organised by a group of volunteers. The website with all further details will be launched by January 2020.
